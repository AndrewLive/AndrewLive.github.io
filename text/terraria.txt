Terraria
ReLogic (2011)

Terraria is an extremely fun game to go through, especially if you have friends to go through the game with. The progressions systems in Terraria are superbly well built and integrated with the other systems in the game to craft an experience where each action in the game feels fulfilling and meaningful to the progression of your game.

With mods such as the Calamity Mod, this experience is even further expanded upon, with countless additional weapons, tools, enemies, and bosses for the player to use and explore. If you have friends to play this with, or even if you are playing alone, I can completely recommend this game.
