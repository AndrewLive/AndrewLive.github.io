CrossCode
Radical Fish Games (2018)

CrossCode is one of my favorite games of all times. It is an Indie Action Role-Playing game released in 2018 after a lengthy Kickstarter and development process.

This game has one of the best top-down combat systems I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The combat is clean, quick, and precise. The combos are flashy while not purely being for show. The game features an elemental combat system that allows you to experiment with many different aspects of the combat system, from lightning quick hit-and-run tactics to steel wall tank strategies.

However, by far the best aspect of this game is the story. CrossCode tells the story of Lea as she attempts to navigate the world of CrossWorlds after waking up without her memories and while being unable to talk. CrossCode tells a tale of friendship and identity that may actually cause you to feel something in that soul of yours.
