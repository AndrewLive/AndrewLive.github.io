Elden Ring
FromSoftware (2022)

I personally do not really like FromSoftware games like DarkSouls or Bloodborne. I find them far too punishing to be reliably enjoyable for me. However, I do really like Elden Ring, FromSoftware's latest Soulslike game.

Elden Ring has a very interesting combat system compared to other games I have played. The combat in Elden Ring tends to force you to really commit to an attack in the form of attack windup time and endlag. While this sounds like a bad thing, I found that it forced me to play much more carefully when taking engagements, which I actually found to be extremely fun and engaging.

In addition, Elden Ring gives you full freedom from the very start of the game to explore and discover your own way to get past difficult encounters. Often if I was struggling on a particular encounter, I could actually come back later after exploring more of the game for more powerful weapons and/or strategies. This also made the game feel less punishing than other FromSoft games I have tried, as I no longer felt like I was constantly banging my head against a wall when at a difficult encounter. 

Overall, these factors made Elden Ring a completely unique playing experience unlike anything I had ever played before.
